# ðŸ“™ Book

This is the book section which will have a full copy of the book Cryptoeconomics: An Introduction. Book development is led by [Jinglan Wang](https://twitter.com/jinglanW). The book will have examples, explanations of how different mechanisms work (or didn't work and failed), a bit of history, and a complete overview of the fundamentals of Cryptoeconomics.
